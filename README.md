Instagram Basic element Display API
The Instagram Basic Display API allows you to access basic data (like photos, videos, and profile information) from an Instagram account. Here's how you can use the Instagram Basic Display API to create a Bootstrap slider that displays Instagram photos.

1. Set Up Instagram Basic Display API
   
1.1. Create a Facebook App
To use the Instagram Basic Display API, you'll first need to create a Facebook App:

Go to the Facebook Developers website.
Create a new app by clicking "Create App" and selecting the appropriate options (e.g., "For Everything Else" > "Something Else").
Name your app and provide your email, then click "Create App ID."

1.2. Add Instagram Basic Display Product
Once your app is created, go to the dashboard and click "Add a Product" on the left side menu.
Find "Instagram" and click "Set Up" under Instagram Basic Display.
Configure the Instagram Basic Display settings:
Add an Instagram account for testing.
Set up the redirect URI that will be used after authentication (usually a page on your server that will handle the access token).
Generate a user access token.

1.3. Get Access Token
To access your photos, you'll need to get an access token:

Go to the Instagram Basic Display product in your Facebook app dashboard.
In the "User Token Generator" section, click "Generate Token" to get an access token for your Instagram account.

2. Fetch Instagram Photos Using the Access Token
Once you have the access token, you can use it to fetch your Instagram photos.

3. Create Bootstrap Carousel HTML
The basic structure of the Bootstrap carousel

4. Style the Carousel
You can add custom CSS to make the carouse

5. Test and Deploy
Test Locally: Make sure the carousel works correctly on your local server.
Deploy: Once everything works, deploy it to your server.

7. Handle Token Expiry
Remember that access tokens have an expiration date. You'll need to handle re-authentication or token refresh, depending on your needs.

This setup should allow you to display Instagram photos in a Bootstrap slider using the Instagram Basic Display API.
